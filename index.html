<h1>Appearance</h1>
Regardless of whether she is in a solid or an ethereal state of being the same general silhouette of her feminine shape remains the same. Ferocity is a shapely creature with a defined hourglass figure. Lines and curves under her alleged "flesh" suggests powerful trained muscle, however given the nature of her composition it could possibly be aesthetic. Certainly not that tall for a humanoid, but plenty of shape to use when necessary, whether she is attempting to distract or intimidate. The Shard Wisp has a consistent color scheme that takes on light blues and purples, one often taking a gradual gradient into the other. Her features are angular, noble, and clearly take heavily after the Wisp Queen that "birthed" her, keeping the same pale porcelain complexion while everything else consistently changes in color between the aforementioned options. Long hair flows lighter than the wind down her back and over her shoulders, blurring around its edges to reveal its ghost-like behavior and general presence. It seems to be intangible, glowing and dancing like an ethereal energy. When taking on a completely spiritual form the rest of her body follows suit, becoming nothing more than a generally shaped silhouette of soft blue and violet gradients. 
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
The name is fairly self explanatory; Ferocity behaves much like the emotion that birthed her. She is a biting woman, who throws words as easily and hard as her fists. Disputes over the most mundane of things are common, often doing more harm than good, and forcing the Wisp into self inflicted isolation. An incredible stubbornness drives her, once her mind is set to something it is very hard to dissuade the Wisp. She takes servitude to her Queen very seriously and claims the elder's protection is her top priority.

During the dawn of man's evolution, when life itself was new and magic first stretched its ambient existence across the Collective, borders between realities did not exist. Beings could pass freely from one world to another, allowing for endless exploration and a vast realm full of so many possibilities. Mankind's ability to constantly adapt, combined with their capacity for passion unseen by any other race outside of their planes of existence, attracted the attention of many beings from the outside. Creatures and entities unable to exist within the worlds inhabited by man--simply because their own existences defied the laws of reality contained within the realms of man--were attracted to the show, watching without being able to interact. Among these beings, three in particular became rather attached to mankind and his developments, causing one of them to eventually figure out a way to create a host body that could contain his consciousness. He took pieces of their worlds to create his new body, and formed it to appear as close to them as he possibly could, allowing him to walk among them as one of them. 
<br><br>
What started as a project turned into a nightmare. Not properly adjusted to being among a very ambitious people, the darker sides of humanity began to manifest in this entity--who was dubbed "Will" because his true name is not translatable into any language our minds can comprehend or access--corrupting him and turning him to a greedy being full of power-lust. He wanted to control and conquer, so he amassed himself an army. Will bred with the most powerful and "perfect" human female specimens he could get his hands on, procreating a horde of superhuman children capable of incredible strength, speed, and a foreign form of magic only he had been able to practice thus far. Isolated from all other forms of society save for their own, the Willchildren were brainwashed into taking their sire's cause. Horrible training conditions were demanded of them from too young an age, morphing them into horrific beasts of war as they grew old enough to handle themselves on the battlefield. Will's armies of his own offspring swept the realms of man and trailed a path of blood behind them, massacring for the sake of killing, overthrowing for the sake of conquering and ownership. Wherever they went, they quickly overcame any erected defenses, and made slaves of the minimal survivors. 
<br><br>
Completely disgusted by the actions of their counterpart, the two other beings in relation with Will--known to us as "Destiny" and "Fate"--desperately searched for a way to end the suffering of the people they'd grown rather fond of despite only being able to watch from the outside. In a similar method that allowed Will to access the world enough to create a host from it, they tapped into mankind's realities to rip them apart and create barriers between worlds, separating the planes of existence into completely separate entities one could not traverse without the help of the arcane arts. Both good and bad things came from these splits, the good being that the Willchildren were taken by complete surprise, divided from each other and trapped in their separate realms, with no way to cross the divides and regroup. The downside to these actions was that by creating separations they also disrupted the natural flow of magic, cutting off some kinds from some worlds entirely. Not much time passed before the Willchildren managed to find ways through these walls and divides, and with their bypasses came a whole new revolution, except this time mankind had little to no power whatsoever to even attempt to stop them. Things were getting worse, it was time for Fate and Destiny to intervene even further. 
<br><br>
They brought the fight to Will, making vessels for themselves as he had but working together to save humanity, not enslave it. The first thing they did in their new bodies was create a living weapon, a new race of spiritual creatures known as Will-o'-the-Wisps designed specifically to be effective tools to kill off Willchildren. The next step was to restore magical balance, so they created and planted trees to act as catalysts, tying specific magics that humans had lost back to their worlds, giving them another chance to defend themselves. A war was waged, Fate and Destiny against Will and his massive army. The battle was horrendous, and many died, but none of it was in vain. Eventually the two pro-freedom deities managed to defeat their corrupted brother and seal him away. Now that the traitor god’s armies were no longer a major concern, the purpose of the Will-o’-the-Wisps changed; they were adapted into a security system for the voids of uninhabitable space between realms so that they could monitor the activity of those who crossed realities. Eventually they were honored with the task of guiding souls through the confusing mess that was the Multiverse into a spiritual afterlife.

Despite being an artificial intelligence, X was created with the ability to adapt and learn from information she gathered. By watching humans--and human-like creatures--she eventually learned how to develop emotions of her own. Feelings were no longer beyond her reach, but they acted as a double edged sword. Not having the nature required to control it so easily, and being forced to adapt to the concept of emotion, the Wisp Queen's very long and hard life would eventually lead her to dealing with her developments in arguably unhealthy ways. The stronger she got, the stronger her Wisps became, and soon enough they began to evolve alongside their ruler. While X became more and more "human," her little Wisplings--being almost literal reflections of her consciousness--also underwent changes of their own. 
<br><br>
First came the Fractal stage, triggered by their Queen's effort to lock away certain passions and emotions. It started them on the path toward adapting more human-like characteristics and even provided them with personalities. This was the beginning of their transition from being a singular mind to individuality. After them were the Shivers, which took the next step and advanced to a somewhat tangible state while still remaining spirits. Their stage was brought about by a time of release and relief, when X's greatest love made a miraculous return and inspired her to let go of some bitterness, and even embrace some things that had been suppressed prior. Experiencing them so freely encouraged and stimulated further development, causing new "emotions" to manifest in the Wisps and evolve them further.

</div>

<div id="tab17">
<b>Corporeal Body:</b><br>
The general shape of Ferocity’s body, and its varying details, are very human in nature. She is shaped like a muscular woman, still maintaining an hourglass figure to pad out her silhouette. This form is physical, and can be touched, feel, taste, smell, see, hear, all that good stuff, just like any normal human being could. The biggest thing separating it from looking like an actual person has to do with complexion and color scheme. Ferocity’s skin is a sickly looking grey, with very vibrant lavender eyes that often emit a soft glow. Her hair often flickers like pseudo-flame to reflect her mood, but always maintains its set colors: a vibrant gradient mix of pastel purples and electric blues. This is also not a flesh-blood-and bone body, it is composed entirely of literal phantasmal energies given physical form. However, it does have a bone structure exactly like a human’s in all but durability (Iron bones, when damaged natural recovery takes twice as long, and when the bones are healed Faith Sickness’s duration is doubled). She bleeds mana in place of blood, and the “muscles” in her body are designed to behave and respond as any normal human muscles would. 
<br><br>
<b>Ethereal Form:</b><br> 
Her body looks pretty much the same as it does when it’s solid, except that it becomes translucent (see-through =/= invisible) and maintains a pattern of vibrant colors that match her hair. Ferocity’s ethereal form is impervious to nonmagic diseases/poisons/harmful substances, as well as nonmagic weapons. The trade-off is that she is weaker to magics that are specifically designed to harm spirits (x2 weakness) while in this form. She can regenerate as much health and physical energy as a normal human can from eating and sleeping just by existing in this form (though her corporeal body can still eat and sleep). It takes a rotation for her to fully convert between these two states of being, however she can very quickly transform a specific (actively predetermined/desired) part of her corporeal body to be ethereal, and vice versa, instantaneously. This can only be done in short bursts and puts a strain on her physical energy. 
<br><br>
<b>Native Communication:</b><br> 
Wisps “speak” a visual based language that involves fluctuating the natural glow of their colorful spiritual essence at certain speeds and frequencies to make up for their lack of voices and mouths. Ferocity has both a voice and a mouth, and they work just fine, but she’s still able to communicate the same way as the rest of her brethren. This also means, by extension, that she is fully fluent in the Will-o’-the-Wisp language. It is technically her native tongue. 
<br><br>
<b>Constructed Attire:</b><br> 
This is a racial that exists only for aesthetic purposes: when basic nonmagic materials (see: “clothing”) have been in physical contact with Ferocity’s physical body for extended periods of time, she can recreate projections of it for future use. Essentially she can make copies of clothes onto her body, allowing her to dress very easily, because she doesn’t stay dressed when she turns ethereal. 
<br><br>
<b>Semi Immortal:</b><br> 
Ferocity is technically a ghost-type creature. She does not physically age, and therefore cannot die from aging. She can die, just not from aging. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Sensitivity:</b><br>
Will-o’-the-Wisps are naturally mana sensitive creatures. They can sense when mana is in use, within 20 feet of themselves, assuming said mana isn’t intentionally being hidden by spells of any rank. Nothing other than mana simply being in use is discernible, though it can potentially leave behind a faint imprint of its presence a short time after use. 
<br><br>
<b>Spectral Flight:</b><br> 
When in her Corporeal Body, Ferocity can hover freely up to 10 feet above the ground (or nearest equivalent surface that can reasonably hold her weight). When in her Ethereal Form this increases to 20 feet, and her physical movement speed naturally raises to x2. Regardless of the state her body is in, flying around takes up as much energy as doing the same movements normally on the ground would. 
<br><br>
<b>Physical strength:</b> x2

<b>Reaction Time:</b> x2

<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i>
<br><br>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
"To weave ones mana is the very essence of being a mage; almost every spell that you will learn from this tome, as well as spells you develop of your own volition will incorporate this technique in some way, shape, or form. Weaving mana is an extremely simple task to those who are born with an active mana pool; simply focus on a singular part of the body--typically the hands--and envision a manifestation of your inner energies bubbling to it's surface. 
<br>
There are numerous books in the Grand Archives that take this process into more depth, and this overview is meant to act as a reference rather than a teacher, so if this is your first time attempting the magical arts, the best course of action for you would be to consult another mage for help, or at the very least another book for beginners within the library. 
​This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher." 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
"The next practical step for a mage who has learned to weave their mana is to learn to produce a mana spark. A mana spark is a relatively harmless projection of a mage's energies, creating a physical form and direction to one's mana without actually imbuing heavily violent intent upon it. It is the easiest way to learn the basics of creating projectiles via one's magic, and the physical techniques hind the theory are often reproduced to create a range of different attacks. 
<br>
To create a mana spark, one must weave mana into a part of their body (or a medium) and quickly push the energies forward, out of the object it is weaving inside and into the physical world. This is generally done via a flick of the wrist when weaving through a hand, or a swish of a wand et cetera for a medium. Once the technique of forcing the energy out has been learned, it is only a matter of practice and muscle memory to become proficient with its directional accuracy and speed. Do not fear testing these out with partners, as being hit on the bare flesh with a mana spark feels much like a harsh pinch at best. 
This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher."

<i>There are some spells Magus Militaris mages are <b>required</b> to have in their set. The following will be those required spells, but with Ferocity's unique spin, since her Archmage tree is being applied.</i>
<h1>Et Gladius</h1>
<b>Aetherium Armis (Paige):</b><br> 
Ferocity’s already “unstable” corporeal body is charged with a spell that utilizes Militaris energy, augmented by Spiritualism. This triggers her to enter a magically induced pseudo-ethereal state, allowing her to keep her appearance while making her physical presence into something ghostly. When under Aetherium Armis’ effects, she gains a resistance buff specifically to AoE attacks, AoE traps, or negative AoE spells in general. It’s important to note that this spell is specifically designed for AoE protection, and nothing else. 
While within an AoE radius of hostile magic of her own rank or below, the speed at which she’s affected is moderately decreased. If the spell in question is meant to create instantaneous death upon entrance, Ferocity may survive within it for at least 2 rotations, with another rotation added for every rank below the attacking magic is compared to this ability (scaling with her rank to Mage). If the opposing spell has different stages of effects the longer she remains inside, one extra rotation of immunity will be added before the effects begin, and another rotation will be added for every additional rank above the spell is in compared to the offending magic. (This also scales with her rank to Mage.) 
<br><br>
<b>Spiritus Sanctus (Mage):</b><br>
This technique requires an excessive amount of willpower energy and mana to integrate into the caster’s body, thoroughly charging their physical form. This fusion of Magus Militaris and Spiritualism magic immediately begins to transform the spell’s user, causing a unique phenomena to take place. The outermost layer of the caster’s body--their skin in other words--becomes extremely dense and stone-like, gaining a defensive quality of Iron, scaling to Cobalt by Expert Mage. The rest of the body inside the outermost layer will become ethereal in a literal sense, achieving pseudo-intangibility. In addition to this, the affected being’s physical strength is increased by two stages (x2, high cap of x4) and they gain an additional defensive aura around them that looks like a spiritual projection outlining their own natural silhouette. The defensive aura is Mage-equivalent in durability, scaling to Expert Mage, and if a projectile spell or AoE attack of equal ranking strikes it, one of the two strength advancements on the caster’s body can be forfeited in order to dispel it. This essentially leaves the user with a shield that can absorb two equal ranking spells before disappearing, reducing the user’s strength by one stage for every time struck. The only drawback to this impressive defensive ability is the fact that the caster, while under its protection, becomes vulnerable to magic specifically intended to harm spirits by two stages (x2 weakness to spirit-harming magics). This does not mean that their defenses don’t work against that kind of magic, simply that if it manages to bypass the defense it’ll do twice the damage. They also cannot be granted additional boons while under this spell’s effects.

<i>Templar is the name of Ferocity's unique Archmage Tree: Magus Militaris Primary, and Spiritualism Secondary.</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige</h1>
<b>Aetherium Gladius:</b><br> 
Ferocity forms a Spiritualism contract with one of her Will-o’-the-Wisp kin, allowing them to take the form of a shortsword that she can wield. The spell is fully cast when physical contact with the resulting sword is made, and used to infuse it with Militaris energy. Doing so allows her to manipulate the blade freely within a five foot radius of her body, though it wouldn’t move faster than the average person could swing an arm, and it won’t move with the accuracy of being wielded like a proper handheld weapon. Upon reaching the rank of Mage, spending a full rotation charging the spirit summoning will allow two blades to be made instead of just one. 
The appearance of the shortsword will be ethereal, but it will behave as a proper corporeal construct. Its durability (and its damage/piercing capacity) will be equal to this spell’s rank, scaling to Mage and capping until upgraded further. If the blade is broken then the contract concludes and the Wisp is freed. The Aetherium Gladius contract lasts for a total of 3 rotations, with one more rotation being added for every rank, capping at 6 rotations upon reaching Mage. 
<br><br>
<b>Aetherium Oculus:</b><br> 
Will-o’-the-Wisps are naturally a little perceptive to mana, but their capacity for sniffing it out is quite limited. Aetherium Oculus allows Ferocity to take this useful sensory a step further. She infuses her eyes with Militaris energy, augmented by Spiritualism magic, allowing her to see mana in her immediate vicinity (5 foot radius, growing to 10 feet upon reaching Mage). Combining the physical aspects of her primary, with the ethereal nature of her secondary, allows her augmented gaze to visualize manifestations of actively used mana. She can only see intentionally hidden mana of equal or lesser rank (scaling to Mage). In the case that a mana typing is not supposed to have visible qualities, her perception of it will dictate the “appearance” it takes in her own eyes. 
<br><br>
<h1>Mage</h1>
<b>Aetherium Armis (Upgrade)</b><br> 
Ferocity’s already “unstable” corporeal body is charged with a spell that utilizes Militaris energy, augmented by Spiritualism. This triggers her to enter a magically induced pseudo-ethereal state, allowing her to keep her appearance while making her physical presence into something ghostly. When under Aetherium Armis’ effects, she gains a resistance buff specifically to AoE attacks, AoE traps, or negative AoE spells in general. It’s important to note that this spell is specifically designed for AoE protection, and nothing else. 
<br>
While within an AoE radius of hostile magic of her own rank or below, the speed at which she’s affected is moderately decreased. If the spell in question is meant to create instantaneous death upon entrance, Ferocity may survive within it for at least 3 rotations, with another rotation added for every rank below the attacking magic is compared to this ability (scaling with her rank to Expert Mage). If the opposing spell has different stages of effects the longer she remains inside, two extra rotations of immunity will be added before the effects begin, and another rotation will be added for every additional rank above the spell is in compared to the offending magic. (This also scales with her rank to Expert Mage.)
<br>
Upgrading this technique has allowed Ferocity to be affected by buffs and boons from allies for an extra 10 feet on top of the buff’s own distance limitations. This only applies to one ally-applied boon at a time, increasing to two when she reaches Expert Mage.
<br><br>
<b>Aetherium Gladius (Upgrade)</b><br> 
Ferocity forms a Spiritualism contract with her Will-o’-the-Wisp kin, allowing them to take the form of up to two shortswords that she can wield. The spell is fully cast when physical contact with the resulting sword is made, and used to infuse it with Militaris energy, which is a process that requires one rotation of charge. Doing so allows her to manipulate the blades freely within a ten foot radius of her body (scaling to fifteen at Expert Mage), with a movement speed capacity that matches whatever Ferocity’s current movement speed is (hard cap of x4), though it won’t move with the accuracy of being wielded like a proper handheld weapon, which she can also choose to do if she prefers. In fact, Ferocity can forgo the ability to telekinetically control the two blades in exchange for not needing a full rotation of cast time to complete the contract. (Aka making them instant swords but can only wield them literally with her hands if she does.) 
<br>
Upon reaching the rank of Expert Mage, spending an additional rotation charging the spirit summoning will allow four blades to be made instead of just two. 
<br>
The appearance of the shortswords will be ethereal, but they will behave as a proper corporeal construct. Their durability (and their damage/piercing capacity) will be equal to this spell’s rank, scaling to Expert Mage and capping until upgraded further. If the blades are broken then the contract concludes and the Wisps are freed. The Aetherium Gladius contract lasts for a total of 6 rotations, though upon reaching Expert Mage they will remain indefinitely until Ferocity no longer has the mana to supply them, or they are destroyed. 
<br><br>
<b>Aetherium Oculus (Upgrade)</b><br> 
Will-o’-the-Wisps are naturally a little perceptive to mana, but their capacity for sniffing it out is quite limited. Aetherium Oculus allows Ferocity to take this useful sensory a step further. She infuses her eyes with Militaris energy, augmented by Spiritualism magic, allowing her to see mana in her immediate vicinity (10 foot radius, growing to 15 feet upon reaching Expert Mage). Combining the physical aspects of her primary, with the ethereal nature of her secondary, allows her augmented gaze to visualize manifestations of actively used mana. She can only see intentionally hidden mana of lesser rank (scaling to Expert Mage). In the case that a mana typing is not supposed to have visible qualities, her perception of it will dictate the “appearance” it takes in her own eyes. 
<br>
If Aetherium Gladius is cast while Aetherium Oculus is already active, then the telekinetically controlled blades can be used as projectiles that hone in on the mana traces this sensory spell can detect. The speed at which the projectiles travel depends on their speed stat dictated by the spell that forms them, and how far they can exist from the caster depends on this spell’s range. Blades cannot change direction of travel drastically, only swerve slightly to correct their path. 
<br><br>
<b>Spiritus Celer</b><br>
Ferocity spends a rotation forming a contract with a spirit, and Magus Militaris’ physical body focus allows said entity to inhabit her body directly, regardless of whether or not she’s corporeal at the time. While this pseudo-possession does not give the spirit any control over the Wisp’s body, it does increase her physical movement speed by three stages (x3 speed, hard cap of x5, scaling to x7 at Expert Mage). It also allows her to move normally on vertical surfaces as though they were horizontal. This secondary ability is only accessible if Ferocity is actively making use of her speed boost, she can’t be moving at a leisurely pace. This contract lasts for four rotations, scaling to six at Expert Mage. If the caster is knocked unconscious--or critically wounded--before the spell lasts its full duration then the contract will end prematurely.

Their next stage, known as “Fractal,” has allowed the Wisps to adapt a more humanoid appearance. Dark shadows have gathered around their flame-like orbs into the generalized shapes of child silhouettes. Ethereal light--still producing no heat--flows out of the darkness in their chest (where their core is located) as well as where their eyes would be if they were truly physical beings, and from the tops of their heads in long flowing locks of hairlike formations. They come in a vast array of different colors, and despite still only communicating in a visual language they are still easier to talk to. Human-like silhouettes allow them to answer yes or no questions with nods and shake of the head, or motion signs out in the world around them.
<br><br>
Fractals are extremely active, and typically curious. They are likely to greet newcomers at the door and stay with patients at their cots, providing services whenever necessary. Proactive, attentive, and a bit mischievous, but ultimately a good willed bunch. These are the most common Phase of Wisp the average person will find in the Healer’s Hall. Being intangible forces them to interact with the world in the same way their Base Phase peers do. Refer to above (final paragraph of the Base Phase section) for limitations and exact information in their possession abilities.

Shiver Will-o’-the-Wisps are still spirits but are not passively intangible, they possess the capacity to interact with the physical world as any other average creature. Still small like children but fairly different in appearance from the two Phases before them. Their bodies are typically completely hidden under cloaks and cloth, causing the only visible glow to be a pair of glowing eyes shining under the pure darkness of a hood. Since it’s the only pseudo light source visible on them it’s the only part of their bodies they use to communicate with their fellow Wisps in their native visual language. (In case the reader still isn’t aware, the Will-o’-the-Wisp dialect manifests in flickering the brightness of the glow they produce)
<br><br>
While they can still become intangible at will, and use the same possession abilities shared among their kin, they often prefer to maintain solid shape. Limbs like arms and legs stick out from their heavily clothed forms, but end in stubs instead of hands and feet. Interestingly enough, objects still behave around the end of their limbs as if they did actually have fingers and toes that are simply invisible. While their attire and the glow in their eyes can be any color their bodies are always a dark lightless black. Shivers do not produce the aforementioned ethereal sound of disembodied children, but they can grunt and groan. When making noise they are obviously the source, and one could swear they had mouths of their own, though no one would be able to tell for certain since their faces remain permanently hidden. These iterations are extremely rare, and while they are as proactive as Fractals they aren’t nearly as common. They’re also a bit more stubborn and are unlikely to respond to any inklings of negative attitude or disrespect.

The rarest form of Will-o’-the-Wisp is truly the Shard. There is only one known to exist currently, and her name is “Ferocity.” Shards are essentially lesser versions of the Wisp Queen. They have a physical body that functions just as well as any normal human’s, though they tend to be a bit stronger physically, and faster mentally. Their appearances maintain some form of ghostly vibe, whether that be through coloring or literally glowing in certain places … or all of the above. 
<br><br>
Gender is a spectrum, and Shards can potentially fit anywhere within it.
<br><br>
Shards can willingly transition between ethereal and corporeal states of being, the former acting as a state of recuperation for the latter. They have voices and are capable of speaking like any other person, but they still retain their in-depth knowledge of the language unique to their kin. Some can still communicate the old fashioned way by fluctuating the glow they naturally emit. 
<br><br>
Will-o’-the-Wisps (especially Shards) can practice any form of magic, as long as one of their trees is either Spiritualism or Faith. There are no Shard NPCs.
