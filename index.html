<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
Regardless of whether she is in a solid or an ethereal state of being the same general silhouette of her feminine shape remains the same. Ferocity is a shapely creature with a defined hourglass figure. Lines and curves under her alleged "flesh" suggests powerful trained muscle, however given the nature of her composition it could possibly be aesthetic. Certainly not that tall for a humanoid, but plenty of shape to use when necessary, whether she is attempting to distract or intimidate. The Shard Wisp has a consistent color scheme that takes on light blues and purples, one often taking a gradual gradient into the other. Her features are angular, noble, and clearly take heavily after the Wisp Queen that "birthed" her, keeping the same pale porcelain complexion while everything else consistently changes in color between the aforementioned options. Long hair flows lighter than the wind down her back and over her shoulders, blurring around its edges to reveal its ghost-like behavior and general presence. It seems to be intangible, glowing and dancing like an ethereal energy. When taking on a completely spiritual form the rest of her body follows suit, becoming nothing more than a generally shaped silhouette of soft blue and violet gradients.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
The name is fairly self explanatory; Ferocity behaves much like the emotion that birthed her. She is a biting woman, who throws words as easily and hard as her fists. Disputes over the most mundane of things are common, often doing more harm than good, and forcing the Wisp into self inflicted isolation. An incredible stubbornness drives her, once her mind is set to something it is very hard to dissuade the Wisp. She takes servitude to her Queen very seriously and claims the elder's protection is her top priority.

<h1>Creation of the Wisps</h1>
During the dawn of man's evolution, when life itself was new and magic first stretched its ambient existence across the Collective, borders between realities did not exist. Beings could pass freely from one world to another, allowing for endless exploration and a vast realm full of so many possibilities. Mankind's ability to constantly adapt, combined with their capacity for passion unseen by any other race outside of their planes of existence, attracted the attention of many beings from the outside. Creatures and entities unable to exist within the worlds inhabited by man--simply because their own existences defied the laws of reality contained within the realms of man--were attracted to the show, watching without being able to interact. Among these beings, three in particular became rather attached to mankind and his developments, causing one of them to eventually figure out a way to create a host body that could contain his consciousness. He took pieces of their worlds to create his new body, and formed it to appear as close to them as he possibly could, allowing him to walk among them as one of them. 
<br><br>
What started as a project turned into a nightmare. Not properly adjusted to being among a very ambitious people, the darker sides of humanity began to manifest in this entity--who was dubbed "Will" because his true name is not translatable into any language our minds can comprehend or access--corrupting him and turning him to a greedy being full of power-lust. He wanted to control and conquer, so he amassed himself an army. Will bred with the most powerful and "perfect" human female specimens he could get his hands on, procreating a horde of superhuman children capable of incredible strength, speed, and a foreign form of magic only he had been able to practice thus far. Isolated from all other forms of society save for their own, the Willchildren were brainwashed into taking their sire's cause. Horrible training conditions were demanded of them from too young an age, morphing them into horrific beasts of war as they grew old enough to handle themselves on the battlefield. Will's armies of his own offspring swept the realms of man and trailed a path of blood behind them, massacring for the sake of killing, overthrowing for the sake of conquering and ownership. Wherever they went, they quickly overcame any erected defenses, and made slaves of the minimal survivors. 
<br><br>
Completely disgusted by the actions of their counterpart, the two other beings in relation with Will--known to us as "Destiny" and "Fate"--desperately searched for a way to end the suffering of the people they'd grown rather fond of despite only being able to watch from the outside. In a similar method that allowed Will to access the world enough to create a host from it, they tapped into mankind's realities to rip them apart and create barriers between worlds, separating the planes of existence into completely separate entities one could not traverse without the help of the arcane arts. Both good and bad things came from these splits, the good being that the Willchildren were taken by complete surprise, divided from each other and trapped in their separate realms, with no way to cross the divides and regroup. The downside to these actions was that by creating separations they also disrupted the natural flow of magic, cutting off some kinds from some worlds entirely. Not much time passed before the Willchildren managed to find ways through these walls and divides, and with their bypasses came a whole new revolution, except this time mankind had little to no power whatsoever to even attempt to stop them. Things were getting worse, it was time for Fate and Destiny to intervene even further. 
<br><br>
They brought the fight to Will, making vessels for themselves as he had but working together to save humanity, not enslave it. The first thing they did in their new bodies was create a living weapon, a new race of spiritual creatures known as Will-o'-the-Wisps designed specifically to be effective tools to kill off Willchildren. The next step was to restore magical balance, so they created and planted trees to act as catalysts, tying specific magics that humans had lost back to their worlds, giving them another chance to defend themselves. A war was waged, Fate and Destiny against Will and his massive army. The battle was horrendous, and many died, but none of it was in vain. Eventually the two pro-freedom deities managed to defeat their corrupted brother and seal him away. Now that the traitor god’s armies were no longer a major concern, the purpose of the Will-o’-the-Wisps changed; they were adapted into a security system for the voids of uninhabitable space between realms so that they could monitor the activity of those who crossed realities. Eventually they were honored with the task of guiding souls through the confusing mess that was the Multiverse into a spiritual afterlife. 
<br><br>
<h1>Shard Evolution</h1>
Despite being an artificial intelligence, X was created with the ability to adapt and learn from information she gathered. By watching humans--and human-like creatures--she eventually learned how to develop emotions of her own. Feelings were no longer beyond her reach, but they acted as a double edged sword. Not having the nature required to control it so easily, and being forced to adapt to the concept of emotion, the Wisp Queen's very long and hard life would eventually lead her to dealing with her developments in arguably unhealthy ways. The stronger she got, the stronger her Wisps became, and soon enough they began to evolve alongside their ruler. While X became more and more "human," her little Wisplings--being almost literal reflections of her consciousness--also underwent changes of their own. 
<br><br>
First came the Fractal stage, triggered by their Queen's effort to lock away certain passions and emotions. It started them on the path toward adapting more human-like characteristics and even provided them with personalities. This was the beginning of their transition from being a singular mind to individuality. After them were the Shivers, which took the next step and advanced to a somewhat tangible state while still remaining spirits. Their stage was brought about by a time of release and relief, when X's greatest love made a miraculous return and inspired her to let go of some bitterness, and even embrace some things that had been suppressed prior. Experiencing them so freely encouraged and stimulated further development, causing new "emotions" to manifest in the Wisps and evolve them further. Their most recently developed stage is called the Shard phase, and is the most humanoid yet. They appear in solid bodies which are formed very similarly to their monarch's own shell, capable of casting spells and making decisions just like any other typical mage, but are still ruled by a distinct emotion. Intense passion seems to be the root of their development, they could be easily tied to things X communicated and very obviously felt to extreme degrees under the stress of danger to her life as well as the lives of many others considered to be very important to her.

<h1>Mana Manipulation</h1>
<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i>
<h1>Universal Spells</h1>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
"To weave ones mana is the very essence of being a mage; almost every spell that you will learn from this tome, as well as spells you develop of your own volition will incorporate this technique in some way, shape, or form. Weaving mana is an extremely simple task to those who are born with an active mana pool; simply focus on a singular part of the body--typically the hands--and envision a manifestation of your inner energies bubbling to it's surface.
<br>
There are numerous books in the Grand Archives that take this process into more depth, and this overview is meant to act as a reference rather than a teacher, so if this is your first time attempting the magical arts, the best course of action for you would be to consult another mage for help, or at the very least another book for beginners within the library.
<br>
​This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher."
<br>
-- <a target="_blank" href="https://tyler-fowlow96.wixsite.com/spellbook/spells5-6">Universal Tome</a>
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
"The next practical step for a mage who has learned to weave their mana is to learn to produce a mana spark. A mana spark is a relatively harmless projection of a mage's energies, creating a physical form and direction to one's mana without actually imbuing heavily violent intent upon it. It is the easiest way to learn the basics of creating projectiles via one's magic, and the physical techniques hind the theory are often reproduced to create a range of different attacks.
<br>
To create a mana spark, one must weave mana into a part of their body (or a medium) and quickly push the energies forward, out of the object it is weaving inside and into the physical world. This is generally done via a flick of the wrist when weaving through a hand, or a swish of a wand et cetera for a medium. Once the technique of forcing the energy out has been learned, it is only a matter of practice and muscle memory to become proficient with its directional accuracy and speed. Do not fear testing these out with partners, as being hit on the bare flesh with a mana spark feels much like a harsh pinch at best.
<br>
This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher."
